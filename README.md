# Java-TSP-Elastic-Net-Solving-Algorithm

@author: str1k6r

This is my realization of Travelling Salesman problem by means of Elastic Net Algorithm implementation on Java language.

It may be not as accurate as exact calculation algorithms, but it's execution time much less so it grants better performance.
This algorithm gives quazioptimal solutions(what means they are good, but probably not the best
(of course it could be best, but not every time, and with growth of data amounts you're less likely to get the best solution))

Since that reason I'd recommend you to run it a few times on single input data so you would get really good solutions.

The 'algor' folder is outdated so there is no reason to use it.
All the useful data kies in folder with README.txt
The optimized code is inside 'Algorithm' folder
The 'algo' folder still stays here because of only the reason I don't know how to delete all the folder together and it doesn't seem possible to do it manually deleting it file by file
